# Passenger_Entries
A Traditional Passesnger Entry Model!

Going back to 80's and 90's, there is no system to count number of passengers entering or leaving the railway station. They used to note it down manually with a pen and paper. Here I've done the same but it's somewhat interesting because I've developed using JavaScript. And yeah, this is my first JS website. This system used to count the number of passesngers travelling in the train by clicking the button.

Hope this is quite interesting and useful!!!
